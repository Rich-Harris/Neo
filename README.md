Neo.js
======

a matrix manipulation library that tries to explain what the hell's going on

*No one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself* -- Morpheus

Some time ago I was writing graphics code for an HTML5 game engine. Turns out you pretty quickly get involved in matrix algebra any time you need to move ('translate'), spin ('rotate'), or embiggen ('scale') any of your game objects without it slowing things to a crawl.

Here's the thing: I clearly didn't pay enough attention in mathematics at school. This stuff is *really confusing* for anyone with a humanities degree. There are some great libraries out there for doing matrix operations (e.g. http://sylvester.jcoglan.com/, or the stuff in Raphael and d3), but if you want to understand what's going on under the hood you're out of luck.

I wanted a standalone library that would help me do matrix operations **optimised for 2D graphics** without confusing the hell out of me. I couldn't find one, so I wrote Neo.js.
